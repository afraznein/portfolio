-Suppose congestion window was 16 segments when timeout occured. How many round trips does it take to deliver 48 segments? (Assume no more lost packets)


//Timout occured at 16 segments, thus we can say that at the time of timeout, SSTH = CW/2, so SSTH = 8. CW is set to 1 at this point.

We double CW each time until we hit SSTH. 
Round 1: cw = 1
	segments delivered: 1
Round 2: cw = 2
	segments delivered: 3
Round 3: cw = 4
	segments delivered: 7
Round 4: cw = 8
	segments delivered: 15

we have hit SSTH here, so now we are only increasing by 1.

Round 5: cw = 9
	segments delivered: 24
Round 6: cw = 10
	segments delivered: 34
Round 7: cw = 11
	segments delivered: 45
Round 8: cw = 12
	segments delivered: 57 (segment delivered here).

So it will take 8 round trips to deliver 48 segments.
