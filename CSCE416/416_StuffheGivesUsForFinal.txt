1)
	11 R1
	110 R2
	0010 R3
	0 R4
	DEFAULT R5

	Match the string
	
	0101 1011? R4
	0010 1100? R3
	1100 1011? R2
	1000 0010? R5
	1110 1110? R1

2)	R1: 111x xxxx = = 32 combinations 
	R2: 110x xxxx -> 1101 1111 = 32 combinations
	R3: 0010 xxxx -> 0010 1111 = 16 combinations
	R4: 01xx xxxx 000x xxxx 0011 xxxx = 112 combinations 
	R5: 10xx xxxx = 64 combinations

5) Distance Vector Routing:

Table at X:

	  U  V  W  Y  Z
	U 0  2  3  2  4
	V 2  0  3  3  5
	W 3  3  0  1  3
	X 1  2  2  1  3
	Y 2  3  1  0  2

Table at X: (Poisoned Reverse)

	  U  V  W  Y  Z
	U 0  2 infinfinf
	V 2  0  3 infinf
	W 3  3  0  1  3
	X 1  2  2  1  3
	Y 2  3  1  0  2


11) A router as an IP address for each network its attached to

Also, parity checking(On the final)

Single bit partity will detect single bit errors but can't correct them
Two-dimensional bit partiy will detec and correct single bit errors.

Type of Error	DETECT		CORRECT
1-BIT              YES		    YES
2-BIT		   YES        	     NO       
3-BIT		   YES		     NO
4-BIT               NO		     NO
5-BIT		   YES		     NO

single bit parity will catch any odd number of bits errors

Policy based routing via advertising(On the Final):
     |--------B---------x
w----A			|
     |--------C----------
	      |
	      ---------------y

A B C are ISP provider networks
w, x and y are customer networks

w : AW is the path. Will w advertise to B? YES
		    Will w advertise to C? Yes

B: BAW is the path. Will B advertise to x? YES (because X is B's customer)
		    Will B advertise to C? NO (there is no benefit to B to advertise)

x: BAW is the path. Will x advertise to C? NO (this would open up a path through X for no revenue gained)

C: CY is the path. Will C announce to x? YES(x is paying me for routes)
		   Will C announce to B? YES(x is paying me for routes)

B: BCY is the path. Will B announce to x? YES(x is paying me for routes)
		    Will C announce to A? NO(neither of these guys are paying me)
		    

'I wont use my resources to carry your traffic unless I get some revenue from it'
