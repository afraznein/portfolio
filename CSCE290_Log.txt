This is an attempt to mark my work on this group project, although it is not definitive, as I keep forgetting to update it.

-November 10- 
1:00 PM -Created git-hub reposity, Uploaded files to repository and created branches for each group member. -ANF
3:05 PM -Summary from class; Create a user guide for Joe Q. Public, as to what is needed, input parameters, how to use this in very basic sense. 5-7 pages. Document the code, get rid of any 'dead code'; Create a systems guide to be handed off to a programmer detailing the ins and outs of the code, how the modules work, variables, etc. Execution order, how are the methods connected, is it a pure tree or do the classes communicate. Start from the top. A hand drawn 'uml' style correlation of all the classes, methods, etc would be a good appendix.
