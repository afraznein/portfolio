-What are the five layers in the internet protocol stack? What are the principle responsibilities of each of these layers?
	Application Layer, Transport Layer, Network Layer, Link Layer, Physical Layer

-What info is used by a process running one one host to id a process on another host?
	IP and port

Missed a question here.

-Is it possible for an organization's Web server and mail server to have exactly the same alias for hostname (for example foo.com)
	Yes, it is possible

-What would the type of resource record that contains the hostname of the mail server?

-Consider sending a packet from a source host to a dest. host over a fixed route. List the delay compnents in the end-to-end delay. Which of these delays are constant and which are variable?
	nodal processing (constant), queueing delay(variable, based on traffic), tranmission delay(variable, based on packet length), propogation delay(constant).

-Suppose users share a 2 mbps link. Also suppose each user requires 1mbps when transmitting, but only transmits 50% of the time. 
--When circuit switching is used, how many users can be supported?
	Two users are allowed.
--Suppose there are 4 users using packet switching. What is the probability that more users are transmitting simul. than that supported by circuit switching?
	Four users, active 1/2 the time.
	P(4) users = 1/16 (1/2 ^ 4)
	P(3) users = Users A, B, C, D
	ABC /D = (1/2)^4 = 1/16
	ABD /C = (1/2)^4 = 1/16
	ACD /B = 1/16
	BCD /A = 1/16
	P(3) users = 4/16
	
	The probability that more users are active is P(4) + P(3) = 1/16 + 4/16 = 5/16

-Consider a new peer Alice that joins BitTorrent without possesing any chunks. Without any chunks, she can not become top-four uploader for any of the other peers, since she has nothing to upload. How then will Alice get her first chunk?
	The 'optimistic unchoke'.

-If a TCP server were to support 10 different clients simul, how many sockets would the TCP server need? How many sockets would a UDP server need? Why?
	11 for TCP. You need one extra so people can 'dial in'. 
	1 for UDP server.

-Suppose 2 hosts. A and B, are seperated by 10^6 meters and are connected by a direct link of R=1mbps. Suppose the propagation speed over the link is 2.5 * 1-^8 meters/sec. Suppose a file of 800,000 bits form host A to host B is sent continuoously as one large message. What is the max number of bits that will be in the link at any given time?
	Distance = 10^6 meters	
	Bandwith = 1MBPS (10^6bitspersecond)
	Speed = 2.5*10^8m/s
	
	Find the propogation delay, then use that to figure out how many bits.
	Prop Delay = Distance/Speed
		   = 10^6 / 2.5*10^8
		   = 1 / 2.5*10^2
		   = 1 / 250 seconds

	How many bits will be in the link at any given time?
	
	10^6 / 250 = 1/250 * 10^3 * 10^3 = 4 x 10^3 = 4000bits.

-How many roud trips would it take to dl a web page that contains 8 embedded objects from the same server? Assume that the page and each of the embedded objects are small and their transmission times are neglibiglbe. Answer this question for each of the following versions of HTTP.

		Client        Server
		      ->
		      TCP
		      <-
			
		      ->
		      GET
		      <-
                C             S

	-Nonpersistent HTTP with no paraellel TCP connections.
		2 round trips times + 2 RTT*8 = 18RTT
	-Nonpersistent HTTP with 2 parallel TCP connections.
		2RR = 8(#ofimages)/2(#ofparallel) x 2RTT(costper) = 10RTT
	-Persistent HTTP connection w/o pipelining.
		2RTT + 8RTT = 10RTT
	-Persistent HTTP connection with pipelining.
		2RTT + 1RTT = 3RTT
