/* Name: Anthony Frazier
 * Class: CSCE355
 * Due Date: November 21, 2017
 * Assignment: Programming Assignment.
 * 
 * Minimizing a DFA:
 * The input DFA is read from a text file given as the first command line
 * argument, and the output DFA is written to standard output. You should use the table-of-distinguishable-states
 * method described in class to do the minimization. You do not need
 * to output the distinguishability table, but you may optionally do so to standard error if you
 * want. Both the input and output DFA descriptions adhere to the format described below.
 * The ordering of the states of the output DFA is not completely determined, so correct answers
 * may differ up to the ordering of states. That's okay, we'll take that into account using our
 * own script that determines whether two DFAs are the same up to reordering states.
