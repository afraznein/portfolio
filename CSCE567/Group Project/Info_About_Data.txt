Lending Club’s interest rates take into account credit risk and market conditions. The final interest rate for each loan grade is the result of the following equation:

Lending Club Base Rate + Adjustment for Risk & Volatility

The Adjustment for Risk & Volatility is designed to cover expected losses and provide higher risk-adjusted returns for each loan grade increment from A1 to G5.

The loan grade is the result of a formula that takes into account not only credit score, but also a combination of several indicators of credit risk from the credit report and loan application. All loans have either a 36- or 60-month term, with fixed interest rates and equal payments.
