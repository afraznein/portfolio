/* Closure Properties: complement and intersection:
	 * There will be either one or two command
line arguments. If one, then it is the name of a file containing the description of a DFA A,
and you are to output the complementary DFA ¬A (see Definition 7.4 of the course notes).
If two arguments, then they both are names of text files containing DFAs A and B, and you
are to output the product construction A ∧ B (see Definition 7.4 of the course notes). A and
B will have the same alphabet. In each case, write to standard output.
