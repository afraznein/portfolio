	/* Determining properties of a DFA:
	 * The sole command line argument gives the file describing
the DFA. Output is to standard output and consists of just two words separated by
whitespace: the first is either "empty" or "nonempty", and the second is either "finite" or
"infinite". Note that the language of a DFA is nonempty iff some final state is reachable
from the start state, and the language is infinite iff there is some cycle that is reachable from
the start state and from which a final state is reachable
