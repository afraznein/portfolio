What does it mean for a program to be 'referentially transparent'?
	 
P = Q -> F(P = F(Q).

When writing an FP/FL program, do you work at the object level or at the function level?
	 
You work at the function level instead of the object level.

Name three combining forms?

	 Composition, apply to all, construction, condition. 

Write a non-recursive FP/FL function to find the length of a sequence. Write down its application to the sequence <3,4,5>? //(minute 14)
	
	len = + @ all: ~1

// ~1 : 'the constant 1 function, whatever its argument is
// all: apply to all / map - applies its argument to every entry in its second argument
// @: f@g is defined as: f@g:x -> f(g(x))

	+@all:<3,4,5>
	//apply to all the constant 1
	(~1:3, ~1:4, ~1:5)
	<1,1,1>
	//sum the entries
	(1+1+1)=3
	return 3.
	
Backus argues that when writing an FP/FL program, you do no need to worry about efficiency, but only about correctness. This is because "mysterious" optimization allow the correctness preserving transformation of inefficient programs into efficient ones. What is "mysterious"?
	
	The FL compiler translates the inefficient, simple FL code into an EFL program, which is a much more complex, but more efficient/optimized codebase.
