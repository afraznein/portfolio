HW8 assigned, due on Thursday, November 9. Do the exercises at the end of Ch.1 [H]. ([H] stands for a reference to the second edition of Hutton's textbook on Haskell. Some of the exercise have solutions in Appendix A.1 of [H]. If you use those solutions, state so.) 

This is a paper-and-pencil assignment; please do not run any code. For exercise 2, give a derivation that is different from the ones in appendix A.1 [H] and use the equational reasoning format of the example on pp.5-6 [H]. 

HW9 assigned, due on the departmental dropbox on Thursday, November 9. Do the exercises from Ch.2 [H] and exercises 3 and 4 in Ch.3 [H]. 

For exercise 2.4, provide two definitions of last. 

Use GHCi (or WinGHCi) and show a script, as follows: 

Please open a .docx or text (if text, please convert to pdf) file and copy and paste from the GHCi or WinGHCi session as needed; 

for exercise 1 in chapter 2, run only the examples that are typed at the interactive prompt (">"); 

for exercises 3 and 4 in chapter 2, also copy and paste from your Haskell .hs file. 

Solutions (beyond in appendix A.1) for the exercises from Hutton's book are easily available. Please, on your honor, do not consult them. Students are asked to install GHCi on their computers. GHCi (ghci) is available on the departmental Linux machines.
